        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees fahrenheit and fill a pot with water and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add guajillo, arbol, and ancho chile peppers to the pot of boiling water and boil for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove peppers from the pot and reserve 1/4 cup of the pepper infused water.</li>
            <li>Rinse beef and pat dry with paper towels. Cut beef to 2 inch chunks and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Heat up a pot over medium-high heat and add oil. Add beef and brown all sides, then remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>In another pan over high heat, add tomatoes and char all sides.</li>
            <li>Place chile peppers in a blender along with tomatoes, vinegar, garlic, 2 teaspoons black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, oregano, salt, and 1/4 cup of the pepper infused water. Then, blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Strain sauce through a mesh strainer and pour over beef. Mix to have sauce evenly covering the beef.</li>
            <li>Place pot (covered) in preheated oven and cook for 3-4 hours or until beef falls apart. Baste beef every 45 minutes with the sauce. Once cooking is done, remove the lid and cook for another 20 minutes uncovered until beef is crispy on top. Remove from oven, cover with 2-layers of aluminum foil, and rest for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove beef from pot and shred the beef with two forks. Place shredded beef back in the pot with the remaining sauce and mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>To assemble the tacos, add beef and condiments (onion, cilantro, cheese) on the tortilla and fold in half. Place tacos on a pan over medium-high heat and cook each side for about 1 minute or until cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Serve with a side of the remaining sauce for dipping.</li>
